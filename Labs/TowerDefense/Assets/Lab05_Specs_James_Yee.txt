Completed everything in the list.

Left click - Drop Turret on spot
Right click - Drop Bloom on spot
Add Screen size slider

Blooms are somewhat confusing to me.
Max 100 Enemies
Max 500 Bullets
Max 50 Turrets
Max 50 Blooms

Bugs:
Blooms have a slight delay in particle animation, and it has a fixed hit box so, 
it will only destroy when hitting near the center of the bloom
If multiple enemies hit the bloom at the same time, they will all de-activate
