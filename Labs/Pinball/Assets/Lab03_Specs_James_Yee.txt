Had problems with understanding the pinball terms.

Player starts with 3 balls, excluding the one in play.
Getting into the outlanes will provide an extra life.
A certain set in the targets will unlock one of the outlanes.
Match will trigger when you have x200 points.

Without rotation, the ball will always hit the same starting point. 

Z for left paddle, X for right paddle, and Up arrow for controlling the plunger.

Bugs:
With how fast the force can stack upon one another, the ball will shoot off into space or more than likely the abyss.
Sometimes the rotation will screw with the plunger and the starting system.
There are times when rotation will stop the ball on it's path out.
