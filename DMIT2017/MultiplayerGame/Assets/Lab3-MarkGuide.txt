You will be making a small game demo for 3 players. Two players will use gamepads to each control a player object that can move around an area and destroy enemy units. The two players will use the first display(monitor) with a split screen. The third player will control the enemy units on the second display using the mouse and keyboard. The enemy units will use a navmesh and be directed to move and attack in a top down RTS view.
