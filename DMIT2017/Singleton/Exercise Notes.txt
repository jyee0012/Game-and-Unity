Create a basic game with the following:

- Overworld map with three dungeon locations. The player can move to a dungeon and enter it.

- Three dungeon levels where the player "fights" monsters and collects items

- Fighting a monster involves reducing the health, increasing the score, and removing the monster

- Monsters may respawn if the player enters the dungeon again



The player info that should persist between scenes are health, score, position on the world map, player name, inventory
