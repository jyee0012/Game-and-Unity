Final Project Goals
1. (Done?) One of the major bug fixes is going to be the dysfunctional save in the win conditions.
2. (Done) Hoping to add the mass select for the player to not require individually selecting units, which i have noticed is annoying once managing 10+ units.
3. (Done) Add models for each unit hopefully.
4. (Done) I have noticed that each unit takes up alot of lag in editor, so I may swap that out for a placeholder that will spawn the unit during play.
5. (Done) Potentially adding the mentioned skills above. 
6. Any other discovered “features” after more play-testing. (Didn't really discover anything)
